SEARCHING AND SORTING:
(BIG O AND OMEGA NOTATION)

- An algorithm is a set of steps to accomplish some task.

- Linear Search
  - Steps taken: 3 steps
  - N
  - O(N)

- Binary Search
  - Steps taken: 3 steps
  - Bigger data sets make this algorithm better than linear search
  - log2(n): Divide by two each time
  - O(log(N))

- What's the greatest number of steps this algorithm will ever take?
- How many steps did each algorithm take?
- What's the fewest number of steps this algorithm could ever take?
  - Omega(1)

- Common notations:
  - O(1)
  - O(log(N))
  - O(N)
  - O(N^2)
  - Omega(1)
  - Omega(log(N))
  - Omega(N)
  - Omega(N^2)


Sort:

- Merge Sort:
  - O(Nlog(N))
  - Omega(Nlog(N))
  - Merge sort recursively divides the list into two repeatedly and then 
  merges the smaller lists back into a larger one in the correct order.

- Selection Sort:
  - O(N^2)
  - Omega(N^2)
  - Selection sort iterates through the unsorted portions of a list, 
  selecting the smallest element each time and moving it to its correct 
  location.

- Bubble Sort:
  - O(N^2)
  - Omega(N)
  - Bubble sort compares pairs of adjacent values one at a time and swaps 
  them if they are in the incorrect order. This continues until the list 
  is sorted.
