POINTERS

- Values are stored in an address in memory (0x500000)
- 0x == anything after it is hexadecimal (Base 16)

int *p = &calls;
- * == pointer that stores the address of a type
- *x == takes a pointer x and gets the value stored at that address
- & == taxes x and gets its address

- Reasons to use pointers
  - You can pass variables to functions by reference, not just by copy
  - Yuo can use dynamic memory (with malloc). Programs can now scale their usage of memory

- Passing by Copy vs. Passing by reference
