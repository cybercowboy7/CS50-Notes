COMPILATION:

Source Code ---> Assembly Code ---> Machine Code (Binary)

program <make> is used to compile our C programs using clang



ARRAYS:

Data type | name of array | size of array

Example: int nights[5];

To put values of items in the array:

int nights[3] = {1, 2, 3};

OR

int nights[3];

nights[0] = 1;
nights[1] = 2;
nights[2] = 3;
